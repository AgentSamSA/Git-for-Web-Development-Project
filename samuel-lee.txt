Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Block elements always start on new lines and take up all the width available, while inline elements do not start on new lines, and only take up what's necessary.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? Elements are then positioned relative to the parent element, or the body element.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Use the inline-block value of the display property, which allows you to alter width, but does not insert a line break so the element can sit with others on the page.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default. Block by default: <div>, <header>, <nav>; inline by default: <a>, <img>; inline-block by default: <button>.
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? The box model is a way to see how HTML elements interact in CSS. It comprises of an outer margin, a border inside of that, padding inside of the border, and finally the actual content of the element all wrapped within the previous 3 parts. Basically, a box inside a box inside a box inside a box. To "fix" the box model, the box-sizing property is used to take into account margin, border, and padding size into the actual value. This way, the actual width/height value is preserved, as without box-sizing the total sum of all 4 parts of the box model is taken into account for the final element size.
